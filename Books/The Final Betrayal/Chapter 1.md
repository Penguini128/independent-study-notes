The Rise of Technocracy

## First Definition of Technocracy
pg. 2, p. 2
> In 1937, the movement described itself like this:
> 
> 	*Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population... For the first time in human history, it will be done as a scientific, technical, and engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics, Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers... Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. (Editor 1937)*

pg. 3, p. 2
> *Technocracy is dealing with social phenomena in the wildest sense of the word; this includes not only actions of human beings, but also everything which directly or indirectly affects their actions. Consequently, the studies of technology embrace practically the whole field of science and industry. Biology, climate, natural resources, and industrial equipment all enter into the social picture. (Hubbert 1934)*

## The Requirements for Technocracy
1. Register on a continuous 24-hour-per-day basis the total net conversion of energy
	- Economic activity is directly dependent upon energy conversion
		- Energy consumed/produced would be pre-determined anyways
2. By means of the registration of energy converted and consumed, make possible a balanced load
	- Once quantified, energy can be allocated to consumers and manufacturers to enable or limit production and consumption
3. Provide a continuous inventory of all production and consumption
4. Provide a specific registration of the type, kind, etc., of all goods and services, where produced and where used
	- Can be enabled by IoT
5. Provide specific registration of the consumption of each individual, plus a record an description of the individual
	- "The hoarding of consumable items was viewed as unauthorized savings."
	- Achieved through total surveillance
6. Allow the citizen the widest latitude of choice in consuming his individual share of Continental physical wealth
	- Humans are viewed as cattle, existing only to be fed, housed, and treated for maximum efficiency
7. Distribute goods and services to every member of the population
	- Every single person in the Technate would be forced to participate.

	The authors attribute the descension of Technocratic ideology on Washington, D.C. today to the [New International Economic Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_International_Economic_Order) and U.N. [Agenda 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21). *(See: [Between Two Ages by Zbigniew Brzezinski](https://ia601302.us.archive.org/7/items/books_201603/between_twoages.pdf))*
